# Home Management System

## About

The project includes a web & mobile client to interact with gathered sensor and camera
data from Raspberry PI devices. 

This is achieved through a scalable web API, a web & android client and raspberry pi scripts for different features such as camera data. 

Features include: 
* Real time sensor data, camera data
* Motion detection,control power sockets 
* Define settings for the alarm to trigger
* Receive notifications if the hardware was being tampered with etc. 

Operations can be performed by either "Admin Accounts" for a group of "standard users" using the web application or "self monitoring users" using the android application.

## Technologies

## Setup / Installation

### Raspberry PI

1. Setup NodeJS & NPM on target device
2. (npm install) Install dependencies for the sub-modules: rpi_breadboard, rpi_camera, rpi_mems_sensor
3. (npm install) Install dependencies for the parent app: rasbpi-app.
4. Depending on the individual hardware setup for the PI, scripts can be run independently (View package.json "scripts")
5. The various device scripts present allow for quick running mirroring the hardware setups during the projects development.

### Webapp

1. Run start.bat/start.sh depending on machine OS.

### Android

1. Standard gradle / android studio workflow.
